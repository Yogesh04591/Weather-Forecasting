# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting Web Application

## 📌 Overview

Weather forecasting is the prediction of the state of the atmosphere for a given location using the Application of science and technology. This includes temperature, rain, cloudiness, wind speed, and Humidity. Weather forecasts are often made by collecting scientific quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve in future. Forecasting could be applied in air traffic, severe weather alerts, marine, agriculture, utility companies, private sector and military application. Weather forecasting is a complex and challenging science that depends on the efficient interplay of weather observation, data analysis by meteorologist and computers, and rapid and rapid communication system. In addition to predictions of atmospheric phenomena themselves, weather forecasting includes predictions of changes on the Earth’s surface climate. These changes are caused by atmospheric conditions like snow and ice cover, storm tides, and floods. The weather forecasting has now become a science and it is performed by adopting the following procedures (steps)Recording of weather data (temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction, cloud forms, humidity and precipitation, visibility, storms etc.).Collection of weather data from weather recording (observations center) stations scattered world over including both land and ocean surfaces.Transmission of weather data collected form major weather stations to sub center. Analysis of weather charts and maps with the help of electronic computers etc. Final forecasting of weather and numerical modelling.

## 🔄 Application Workflow

1. User enters a city name or allows geolocation.
2. An API call fetches weather data.
3. Data is parsed and displayed on the dashboard.
4. Weather metrics and forecast details are shown.
5. Optional graphical representation for enhanced clarity.

## 🧪 Performance & Accuracy

- Uses `setInterval` to update time and date in real-time.
- Implements filtering to provide daily forecasts (not hourly spam).
- Error handling for API failures and permission denials included.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 📱 Develop a mobile application version with push notifications.
- ⏰ Real-time severe weather alerts.
- 📈 Historical weather data visualization.
- 🌐 Integration with multiple weather APIs for higher accuracy.
